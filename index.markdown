## About me

I am a computational biologist working in the [lab of  Molly Przeworski'](https://przeworskilab.com/) at Columbia University. Every biological adaptation emerges from an accidental alteration to the genome that, through genetic shuffling and the interplay of drift and selection, eventually establishes itself in a population. My current research focuses on understanding two fundamental mechanisms in this evolutionary process: mutation and recombination.

### The determinants of germline mutations in mammals

In humans, germline mutations arise more often in males than in females, a phenomenon termed “male mutation bias.” In a recent [publication](https://elifesciences.org/articles/80008), Felix Wu and I leveraged differences in substitution rates in sex chromosomes vs. chromosomes to show that the male mutation bias also occurs in 42 species of amniotes. We provide a novel model to explain the male mutation bias in light of damage-induced mutation, helping to reconcile with recent evidence suggesting replication errors are not the main source of germline mutation. You can find the code to reproduce our findings in this [link](https://github.com/marcdemanuelmontero/mut_sex_bias_amniotes).

### The localization of recombination across vertebrates
Until now, it was believed that the location of recombination in vertebrates was determined by one of two mechanisms: one associated with the protein PRDM9 and another by promoter-like features. By studying patterns of linkage disequilibrium and crossover events in pedigrees, Carla Hoge and I show that these features are not mutually-exclusive, and instead reflect a tug of war between competing signals that has more lopsided outcomes in some species than others. Please check the [preprint]((https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.11.548536v1)) and [code](https://github.com/marcdemanuelmontero/SnakeRecombination/tree/main/analyses) to learn more.
